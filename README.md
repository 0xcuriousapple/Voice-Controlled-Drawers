This was our first year summer project called as "Smart Drawers". Idea here is you say the item using mic in your android application, then this android application using WiFi pass this information to ESP module which is connected to Arduino, which processes request to find the particular drawer for that particular item. In this repository you will find Android application, Documentation (Informal) and codes. In codes there are two folders one is for Arduino, other is source code for app. So its Android + IOT, anybody who want to link these two can use our source code. You will have to make changes in only I/O. Why Application is named as AAM? - coz of Creators (Abhishek, Anuj and Mayank).
